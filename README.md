Promptus - A Unified Education Data Hub
Promptus is a front-end web application prototype designed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). It serves as a centralized platform to create, manage, and securely track the complete educational and professional journey of students, alumni, and teachers. The project aims to solve the problem of scattered educational data by providing a single, verifiable source of truth.
This project is built entirely with front-end technologies and uses browser localStorage to simulate a back-end database for user registration and profile management, making it fully functional for demonstration purposes.
