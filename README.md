# Promptus - A Unified Education Data Hub

**Promptus** is a front-end web application prototype designed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)**.  
It serves as a **centralized platform** to create, manage, and securely track the complete educational and professional journey of students, alumni, and teachers.  
The project aims to solve the problem of *scattered educational data* by providing a **single, verifiable source of truth**.

This project is built entirely with **front-end technologies** and uses **browser localStorage** to simulate a back-end database for user registration and profile management, making it **fully functional for demonstration purposes**.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

This is a **pure front-end application** and requires no server setup.

1. **Download the Files**  
   Ensure all HTML files (`index.html`, `tracker.html`, etc.) are in the same directory.

2. **Open in Browser**  
   Launch `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave).

That's it! Profiles are saved directly to your browser's local storage.
